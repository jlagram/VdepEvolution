# Code for predicting full depletion voltage evolution

Many input information are necessary. Some directory are dedicated to these.

## Predictions

Directory with the main code.

## EnvConditions

Codes and data files for creating an luminosity and temperature scenario.

## InputData

All input information needed for the predictions like fluence, temperature and leakage current maps. A code allows to merge everything in a single .root file.
